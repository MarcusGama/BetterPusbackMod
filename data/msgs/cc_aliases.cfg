# This a country-code-aliasing file. It consists of two-word sequences
# in the form of:
#
#	XX	YY
#
# Where "XX" and "YY" are two-letter country codes. It simply serves
# to override BetterPushback's assumption of what country it is in.
# This used to extend the reach of a country-specific sound pack. For
# example, "en_GB" would normally only be matched when located in the
# United Kingdom. However, with this aliasing mechanism, we can map
# places like British overseas territories onto the GB sound pack,
# so those places will also use the en_GB audio pack.

# British overseas territories
AI	GB	# Anguilla
BM	GB	# Bermuda
